# JOURNAL — optimizer handover (append-only, whole run)

YOU (the optimizer) own this file. It is the running, accumulating handover across ALL iterations — accepted AND rejected — and it is NEVER reset. Each iteration you APPEND one new entry at the bottom (under the marker line); you do NOT edit or delete earlier entries. Read the whole journal before proposing, so you build on EVERY prior attempt (not just the last accepted one) and never re-test a refuted idea.

You CANNOT know your own gate result while you write — the harness scores you AFTER you stop and stamps a **RESULT** line (outcome + Δ + the EXACT tasks you broke/fixed) right below your entry. So do NOT write 'what worked' as a guess. To learn what actually worked, READ the framework RESULT lines of prior entries (and LEDGER.md): an entry whose RESULT says `rejected` with `broke={...}` tells you which specific edits to drop or redesign — its diff.patch is in ./prior_iterations/<id>/.

Append your entry for THIS iteration below the marker, using this shape (INTENT only — the framework appends the RESULT):

    ## Iteration <your candidate id> — <one-line headline of what you tried>
    - Changes I made (1 line per edit; name the file/tool + cluster it targets):
    - Per change, the EXPECTED effect + why it's safe (which failing task it should fix;
      why no passing task changes behavior):
    - Building on prior RESULTS: which prior entries' broke/fixed I used, and what I
      did NOT re-try because a prior RESULT showed it regressed (cite ids):
    - Refuted hypotheses (a prior RESULT proved this is NOT the fix — never re-test):
    - High-value clusters still NOT cracked (and the guard/tool designs already tried):
    - Plateau signal (are the last few RESULTs flat/negative? if so, which LEVER to switch
      to — e.g. a NEW composite tool instead of another guard, or prompt instead of code):
    - Focus next iteration:
