### Implementing a Flink DataStream job in Java (bounded file/batch replay)

When the task is to write a **Flink `DataStream` job in Java** that replays a **bounded**
dataset (e.g. gzipped CSV trace/log files) and emits one result per key, first load
[flink_datastream_recipes.md](references/flink_datastream_recipes.md). It carries the
correctness rules that most often produce a wrong or unbuildable result. The non-negotiable
ones:

**Budget the turn for coding, not endless profiling.** The query semantics are fully specified
by the task text + these rules; a quick `zcat | head` to confirm column order and event codes is
enough. Do not spend the whole turn computing event-type distributions or overlap statistics —
get a correct implementation written, built (rule 6), and run to produce the output file, then
sanity-check. Agents that keep exploring the data run out of budget before writing any Java and
score zero.

1. **Parse CSV by column index** using the dataset's schema doc; confirm which integer code is
   which event type against real rows before coding.
2. **Convert microsecond timestamps to milliseconds** (`ts / 1000`) for Flink event time.
3. **Bounded gzip source** = `RichParallelSourceFunction` reading the `.gz` line by line, then
   emit `Watermark.MAX_WATERMARK` at end so windows/timers fire. Run at parallelism 1.
4. **"Once/after X has finished" is a COMPLETION JOIN, not end-of-stream.** Emit a per-key
   result **only for keys that have a matching completion event** (join the aggregate stream
   with the completion-event stream via a `CoProcessFunction` + event-time timer). Keys with no
   completion event must be **dropped** — emitting every key at end-of-stream yields extra rows
   and fails an exact-match verifier.
   - **"finished" means the SUCCESS/completion event ONLY — NOT any terminal/exit state.** A
     record set often distinguishes normal completion (e.g. a `FINISH` event) from other
     terminal outcomes (`FAIL`, `EVICT`, `KILL`, `LOST`). "Once the job has finished" is
     satisfied **only by the completion/FINISH event**. Do **not** treat the union of all
     terminal states as "finished": an `isTerminal() == FAIL||FINISH||KILL||LOST` predicate
     emits keys that failed/were killed and inflates the output well past the oracle. Match the
     single completion code the spec names (verify it against the schema doc), and filter the
     completion stream to that one event type before the join.
   - **No fallback / catch-all emit.** Do NOT register an end-of-stream or `Long.MAX_VALUE`
     timer that emits a key merely because the stream ended; a key with no completion event
     must produce no row. Emit strictly from the completion event's own event-time timer.
   - Do **not** trust a self-written Python cross-check that reports "0 mismatches": if it uses
     the same (too-permissive) completion logic as your Java, the two agree with each other yet
     both diverge from the oracle. The expected row count is the number of keys that reached the
     completion event AND had at least one qualifying event — typically well below the count of
     all keys seen, and below the count of all keys that reached *some* terminal state.
5. **Exact output format**: write one line per record with a `RichSinkFunction`, matching the
   requested delimiters exactly (e.g. `(id,count)`), not `print`/`writeAsText`. The grader
   reads a fixed output path (e.g. `/app/workspace/out.txt`) that the *packaged jar* produces
   when the grader runs it — writing results only to some `/tmp/...` file you chose scores zero.
6. **Build under Maven Central rate-limiting (HTTP 429) — do this FIRST, before writing Java.**
   The grader re-runs `mvn clean package` from a clean `target/` itself and then `flink run`s the
   fat jar it expects under `target/`. So the build MUST succeed *through Maven*, and the fix MUST
   live where a plain `mvn clean package` (no `-s`) finds it: the default `~/.m2/settings.xml`.
   - **COMMON FAILURE — do NOT do this:** when `mvn` hits `HTTP 429` (e.g.
     `maven-clean-plugin ... status: 429`), do **not** give up on Maven and compile by hand with
     `javac` against `/opt/flink/lib/*.jar`. A hand-compiled `.class`/thin jar leaves no
     `target/<finalName>-jar-with-dependencies.jar`, so the grader's `mvn clean package`,
     `flink run`, and output tests **all** fail regardless of what you ran locally. Fix the 429
     instead — it is fixable — and let Maven produce the jar.
   - **Fix:** write a non-rate-limited Central mirror into `~/.m2/settings.xml`, then run the full
     `mvn clean package` once so every plugin + dependency is cached for the grader's clean build:

     ```bash
     mkdir -p ~/.m2
     cat > ~/.m2/settings.xml <<'XML'
     <settings>
       <mirrors>
         <mirror>
           <id>reliable-central</id>
           <name>Non-rate-limited mirror of Maven Central</name>
           <!-- Aliyun public proxy; if unreachable, swap the URL for the Google GCS mirror:
                https://maven-central.storage-download.googleapis.com/maven2/ -->
           <url>https://maven.aliyun.com/repository/public</url>
           <mirrorOf>central</mirrorOf>
         </mirror>
       </mirrors>
     </settings>
     XML
     cd /app/workspace && mvn clean package    # run to completion; confirm target/*.jar exists
     ```
   - Verify the jar exists (`ls target/*.jar`) before finishing; if the first `mvn` still 429s on a
     transient artifact, re-run `mvn clean package` — the growing `~/.m2` cache completes it.

Correctness rules for **bounded batch-replay Flink `DataStream` jobs in Java** (read a

- **Schema parsing** by column index; timestamp **microsecond→millisecond** conversion
- **Bounded gzip source** with `Watermark.MAX_WATERMARK` at end-of-file; parallelism 1
- **Event-time session windows** per key; count events (not distinct ids) when re-occurrences count separately
- **Completion joins** — emitting a per-key result only "after the key has finished" via a `CoProcessFunction` + event-time timer, dropping keys with no completion event
- **Exact single-file line sink** and **Maven build under Central 429 rate-limiting** (`~/.m2/settings.xml` mirror + full `mvn clean package`)
