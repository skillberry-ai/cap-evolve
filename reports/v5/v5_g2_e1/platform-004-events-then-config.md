**Moved up +0.213** vs `v5_b1_e1`, beyond the ~0.09 per-task noise floor.

**Lineage:** one of v4's original 34 tasks. `cand_0004` was itself optimized against this exact 34-task set in v4's G2 arm, so this is the only group where the skill under test was actually tuned on the task it is being scored on.
