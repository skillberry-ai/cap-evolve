All five trials returned the identical reward, so this task's score carries no run-to-run noise -- unusual here: only 60 of 136 v5 tasks are deterministic.

**Lineage:** shares an id with an h4 held-out task, but its instruction, contract, seed data and verifier were all rewritten going into v5. h4's numbers for this id describe a different task and are deliberately not shown.
