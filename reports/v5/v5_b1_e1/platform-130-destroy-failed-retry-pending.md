This task is **non-deterministic**: five identical trials spanned 0.440-1.000 (sd 0.206). With n=5 its mean carries a ~95% CI of roughly +/-0.127, so a later arm's change on this task alone is only meaningful well above that. It is one of 92 of 136 v5 tasks (68%) that vary across repeats.

This task came from the **`v5_2026-10-12`** drop (the second 68). The two drops are statistically indistinguishable in difficulty (permutation p = 0.62) -- see [`../../../results/v5/v5_b1_e1/summary.md`](../../../results/v5/v5_b1_e1/summary.md).
