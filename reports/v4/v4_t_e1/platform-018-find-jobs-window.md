## What this task is about

Asks how many runs of a specific job template failed within a given controller and date range. All three filters -- controller, date range, status -- matter: dropping any single one yields the same wrong count, so the right answer is only reachable by applying all three.

T2 never targeted this task: its seed bundle already scored a perfect 1.0 on our baseline run (`our_baseline`), so there was no headroom to optimize against (spec Sec.3). `seed`/`best`/`final` above all repeat `our_baseline` because no independent optimizer measurement exists -- they are not three separate results.

This task will be evaluated again once a category or global merge (C3/C4/G3/G4, spec Sec.2) produces a bundle edited by other tasks' optimizer runs, as a regression check (spec Sec.3).
